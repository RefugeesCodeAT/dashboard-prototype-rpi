# MoodleBox-dashboard
**Purpose**:

Our final project is to build a prototype for the Refugees code R{c} community. Its educational platform moved from being an idea to a basic implementation that presents more facilities and motivation to the participants.

**User stories**:
-	As a user I like collecting points.
-	As a user I like to join a course on Moodle by pressing a button
-	As a user I like to earn points when I finish a course in MoodleBox
-	As a user I like to level up after X points
-	As a user I like to have a profile, a secure log-in, see my friends and events (not fully implemented yet)

R{c} community is building applications for their school infrastructure:
* the main Moodle platform where the participants can access the courses and educational stuff.
* Sports finder APP that helps users to create sports events and keep track of the newest event that has been published by other users.
* Event APP where the community of R{c} can manage and organize events.
* The store APP where the participants can access different resources (hardware and software). 
* A Hackathon project Dashboard
* A Check-in module for time-tracking.. etc.

Some of previous APPs have already done, and others we are still working on.

Our goal is to create a Dashboard platform that interacts with MoodleBox, creating an extendible shell of gamified platform-learning for the registration in R{c} and courses enrolment issues.

**The main goal of (MoodleBox-dashboard) is to**:

-	Registration in R{c} program: add new participants to the R{c} community for the current intake.
-	All in one: Collect all such applications related to R{c} community in one place, then the participants can access easily all APPs   using our Dashboard.
-	Learn & Fun: Give the opportunity to R{c} participants to interact easily and effectively with the MoodleBox for course registration and to give them some motivation by collecting XP (experience points) and level them up depending on their progress and achievements, then as a motivation, more score they achieve more facilities and gifts they get (games, attending an event for free, free courses. etc).

After success login/registration, the user will be redirected to the home page where we can see many issues:

-	First and last-name, username, profile picture and email address. 
-	MoodleBox registration button: to access the courses and enrolment issues we need to register on MoodleBox, after clicking the registration button all credential data related to the user (name, username and email) will be sent to MoodleBox, and a notification of successful registration will be shown. 
-	XP (Experience Points): total number of scores the user has already collected. User can gain points by finishing the course that he/she has already enrolled in.
-	Level: current level depending on the user’s achievements. the user will be levelled up each time he/she earns a specific amount of points.
-	Enrolled courses: courses in progress and not finished yet.
-	Finished courses: courses are already done.

Later on, and **as a future work** we are going to improve our prototype by adding the tools to access other R{c} applications that have been already mentioned above, in addition to add some improvements and related information to the home page such as:

-	**“my account”** option: where the user will be able to change his/her name, password, or even image.
-	**"about us"** option: which is one page displays our team, as a part of R{c}, the goal and future perspective for our community.
